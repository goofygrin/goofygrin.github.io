I'm frequently asked advice from friends and family about starting and running a business.  I don't have the most experience and my knowledge is limited.

That said, I tend to give the same advice and typically follow up with an email with a bunch of links.  Following Hanselman's lead, I'm publishing them so 
that I can help more than that one person.

In no particular order:

* [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com Hacker News) Fast moving news, articles, information
* [Launch DFW](http://launchdfw.com/ Launch DFW) Local startup resources, meetups, etc.
* [VPS Hosting](http://knownhost.com) I've been a customer for years.  Great support.
* [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com/training) Videos for just about any programming tasks
* [Dallas MarkerSpace](https://dallasmakerspace.org) If you need to prototype something, join DMS
* [r/Entrepreneur](http://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur) Reddit Entrpreneur community
* [r/startups](http://www.reddit.com/r/startups) Reddit startup community
* [TinkerCAD](https://tinkercad.com/) Free online CAD tool
* [HTML5UP](http://html5up.net/) Free Web Designs (this site is one)

Recent articles that I think are worth reading

* [Fast Interactive Prototyping with D3](http://snips.net/blog/posts/2014/01-10-fast-interactive_prototyping_with_d3_js.html)
* [How We Restarted Our Company in Two Weeks During Y Combinator](http://blog.eventjoy.com/post/79387694078/how-we-restarted-our-company-in-two-weeks-during-y)

Beyond that... the best advice I give to people is to DO IT.  Thinking about it, worrying about it, talking about it is not the same as living it.  You have to 
take the risk and jump off the cliff.  Don't spend a lot of money up front.  If you just have an idea and no technical skills, get the technical skills because 
you'll have no way to validate what anyone technical tells you (whether a freelancer or a [potential] partner).
