tl;dr; Save your money for now.

I had high hopes for the Fire TV (unfortunately named with the Kindle Fire family).  I want a single device to do everything my family does:

* Netflix
* videos (avi, mkv, .iso DVD rip) from a NAS or server
* music from a NAS
* work with my Harmony remote

Anything else is an added bonus.  The Fire TV has a couple bonuses:

* Amazon Prime Video
* Games
* It runs Android, so sideloading apps is a possibility

First off, the Fire TV's remote is bluetooth.  So there's no using my Harmony.  That's immediately a deal breaker.

Fire TV can't play anything on my NAS/servers without using something like Plex.  Plex has never been something I've been interested in setting up 
because I don't really want to transcode all my content on the fly.  And it hammers the network since it has to (potentially) go from the nas to the 
server and then get transcoded and then sent to the consuming device.  And Plex isn't free.

Netflix works well (as it should, it's an Android app).  Amazon Prime video is terrible.  You have a LOT of options, but none that you can actually watch for free.  Many times you have to enter the item, then click "other options" and see if you get it with your Prime subscription.  Basically it's a giant waste of time.

And the app ecosystem... vendor lock-in.  I've already bought/acquired a lot of games and apps from the Google Play store.  Now I have to buy them again to use 
with the Fire TV?  And they're tied to my Amazon devices only?  I'm out.

The form factor is great.  Lots of potential.  But definitely not a solution for me.
